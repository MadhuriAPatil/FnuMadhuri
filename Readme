# Package Sorting Function

##  Objective
This project implements a function to classify packages in Thoughtful’s robotic automation factory.  
Packages are sorted into stacks based on their **volume, dimensions, and mass**.

##  Rules
- A package is **bulky** if:
  - Its volume (Width × Height × Length) is **≥ 1,000,000 cm³**, OR  
  - Any dimension is **≥ 150 cm**.
- A package is **heavy** if:
  - Its mass is **≥ 20 kg**.

### Stacks
- **STANDARD** → not bulky and not heavy  
- **SPECIAL** → bulky **or** heavy  
- **REJECTED** → both bulky **and** heavy  

##  Implementation
The function `sort(width, height, length, mass)` takes the package dimensions (in cm) and mass (in kg), and returns the stack name.

```python
def sort(width: float, height: float, length: float, mass: float) -> str:
    volume = width * height * length
    bulky = volume >= 1_000_000 or max(width, height, length) >= 150
    heavy = mass >= 20
    return "REJECTED" if (bulky and heavy) else ("SPECIAL" if (bulky or heavy) else "STANDARD")
